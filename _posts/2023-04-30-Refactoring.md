I must admit that I am still in the new story. It gains momentum and takes on  
a viral life of its own. Those who do not know what this is about should go  
back and read the post from last week.  
There is a feeling of bingo in the air.  

What interests me now is to examine the rollout process. Well, we all have an  
existing process that generally works.  
If it works then why change?  
A somewhat familiar question. Get settled, a legitimate question.
So why change?  

I will ask the same question but in a slightly different way:  
What is good about refactoring?  

I have pretty firm opinions on the subject, but I'm open to hearing your
opinions.  

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?  
A good and magical week.
