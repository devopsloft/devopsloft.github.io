Well... I missed my own deadline. Happens. Happened. Will happen.

Last week I was busy with a new and slightly different project.
Managing the permissions scheme for the tree of Git projects managed in the
namespaces tree in Gitlab.
On the face of it, it sounds uncomplicated. This is true until product discovery
is conducted. Do you know what is it?

This is from the product domain. What is the connection between devops and
product. In most if not all of the organizations I've encountered, and I must
admit that I've encountered quite a few of these, the devops people receive a
short and concise requirement. Characterize the solution, implement and deploy.
And continue on more or less.
Most of the time this is satisfactory, but sometimes we forget that there are
users on the other side. Our users are the development people (not only). But
they deserve a good user experience if not better. We all want to implement
new features as quickly, as qualitatively, as we say. And in order for all this
goodness to happen, someone has to extract the requirements and understand in
depth what the users really need.  
This is where the product discovery process comes in. Sit with the helpers and
dig for them until you extract the maximum possible requirements. User-stories
are created from the requirements and from here the road to design,
implementation and deployment is already paved.

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?
