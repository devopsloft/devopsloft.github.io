# Continuous Improvement

Original Facebook post in Hebrew [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devopsloft/posts/1818561898537339/)

Good morning, have a good week and happy holidays,  

Once again a slightly different post than usual. A behind-the-scenes look at
this group.  
In recent weeks we have been watching the increasing involvement of
[Evan Slatis](https://www.facebook.com/hippyod).  
For the avoidance of doubt, involvement is welcome.  
Those who haven't noticed yet, he doesn't exactly know Hebrew and he's not even
that much of a resident of the country.  
So in order to understand our posts, he used a Facebook feature that translates
the texts into English.  
And not surprisingly, the resulting translation is not always coherent.  
In the last post, after the feedback he gave, I went and translated the post
into English using google translate.  
I started digging and still haven't reached the point. Normal situation for
me.  
Have you lasted this far? Another little effort and it will come. Promises!  
And the result is not 100. A post in two parts. The first part is in Hebrew and
the second in English. Facebook does not fly over such posts.  
So, here's the point.  
This use case leads me to change. The motivation is to provide a solution to
the use case that I dug into in detail above.  
There is a situation where I am trying to "kill" a fly with an elephant and
still, I go for it. What is there to lose? (Don't answer, a kitbag question if
it wasn't clear)  
And the elephant in this case is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
In the first step, I will translate my posts into English and they will be
displayed in a blog based on GitHub Pages.  
I want to believe that this technology will allow options to combine posts in
Hebrew and English. I haven't checked in depth but I have an intuition and I go
with it.  

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?  
A good and magical week.
