Original Facebook post in Hebrew [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devopsloft/posts/1818561898537339/)

Good morning, have a good week and happy holidays,<br>
<br>
Once again a slightly different post than usual. A behind-the-scenes look at
this group. <br>
In recent weeks we have been watching the increasing involvement of
[Evan Slatis](https://www.facebook.com/hippyod). <br>
For the avoidance of doubt, involvement is welcome. <br>
Those who haven't noticed yet, he doesn't exactly know Hebrew and he's not even
that much of a resident of the country. <br>
So in order to understand our posts, he used a Facebook feature that translates
the texts into English. <br>
And not surprisingly, the resulting translation is not always coherent. <br>
In the last post, after the feedback he gave, I went and translated the post
into English using google translate. <br>
I started digging and still haven't reached the point. Normal situation for me.
<br>
Have you lasted this far? Another little effort and it will come. Promises! <br>
And the result is not 100. A post in two parts. The first part is in Hebrew and
the second in English. Facebook does not fly over such posts. <br>
So, here's the point. <br>
This use case leads me to change. The motivation is to provide a solution to
the use case that I dug into in detail above. <br>
There is a situation where I am trying to "kill" a fly with an elephant and
still, I go for it. What is there to lose? (Don't answer, a kitbag question if
it wasn't clear) <br>
And the elephant in this case is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). <br>
In the first step, I will translate my posts into English and they will be
displayed in a blog based on GitHub Pages. <br>
I want to believe that this technology will allow options to combine posts in
Hebrew and English. I haven't checked in depth but I have an intuition and I go
with it. <br>
<br>
<br>
I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:- <br>
Did this post bring you new insights?<br>
Did you learn something you didn't know before?<br>
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?<br>
A good and magical week.<br>
