Pausing for a second to share a video that made a lot of sense in my mind. In
recent months I hear more and more the concept of platform engineering.
Intuition felt to me that this was the next thing for me. Not exactly the next
but what is today and another layer. But I didn't know how to explain to others
what it meant.

So receive the ultimate, clear and simple explanation with drums and dances.
A little less than 43 minutes. You don't have to watch until the end because
there is no good without trying to sell me and you something. Lest it be implied
that there is anything wrong with this practice. I'm all for it.

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?
