After opening and closing parentheses in last week's post, I'm back on track. No
a question. Time is short and the work is plentiful.
The goal is - to set up a DEV environment with a Gitlab server and also a
runner running on minikube. And all this goodness using devcontainer and helm
chart.
In the previous post (not the one from last week. The one before it) I shared
that I ran into some problem that at the time I didn't have the solution to. And
when I'm stuck, I also know how to ask for help. And the one who came to my aid
is [Guy Inger][2]. His [PR][3] is still in the review stage, so if you have
something to contribute, add, feedback then now is the time.

What's more, I came to know that there is no sufficient information in the
project about how to set up the DEV environment. Having the devcontainer
configuration files doesn't make it clear enough for a new contributor. So
today, I will work on that too. I will improve the README and maybe I will find
a volunteer who wants to do a review for me.

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?
