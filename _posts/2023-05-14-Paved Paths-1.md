I have been experiencing a writing block for the past few days. And so, I'll
make it short and sweet this time.  
I recommend a series of [blog posts][3] in which I find both interest and new
terminology that I am going to warmly adopt.  
Maybe by next week I will be able to bring a little more in-depth insights that
I took from reading them.

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?  
A good and magical week.

P.S. Want to talk to me one on one. Click on
