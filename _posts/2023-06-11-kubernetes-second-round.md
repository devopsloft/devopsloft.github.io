Summary of the previous chapters on the way to the destination -
[kubernetes][3]:  
I started with the project itself but encountered difficulties due to the
architecture of my laptop- macOS M1. I tried [kind][4] which worked quite nicely
and also [colima][5]. Both worked on the laptop but I was not able (in the short
time I invested in them) to use them in CI. And finally, I got to [minikube][6]
thanks to one recommendation from last week. I have an environment that works
both locally (development environment) and there is also an environment that
works in CI. And when I say local I mean the [dev container][7] environment.
This was made possible because there is a [feature][8] that fit me like a charm.
Oh, one more little detailâ€¦ I proceeded to install gitlab ci runner using
[helm chart][9] and it worked like a dream.  

What's more, I haven't yet found the elegant way to share secrets in both
environments. Right now, I'm using the values file in the DEV environment.
While in the CI environment I use [GitHub Secrets][10]. Not the [DRY][11]est to
say the least. A tech debt that I will close as soon as possible.  

And below is the [project][12] in which I implemented the entire tech stack
mentioned above.  

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?
