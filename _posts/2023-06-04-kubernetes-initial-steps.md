I finally returned to Israel after a significant stay in Milan, Italy. Back to
Israeli time.  
Sunday at 10:00 a new post lands.  
Last week I updated that I am entering the world of Kubernetes. Yes yes... the
time  
has come even though I have been in business for years, just not at the level  
I would like to be at.  
So, I made a move forward and also one backwords. I said to myself, how do one  
starts with a new technology when the table is completely clean. For me the  
answer is quite clear. First of all, clone the project, go through the  
instructions and start a development environment.  
Oh, here I failed. It turns out that the combination of macOS M1 and  
Kubernetes still does not work smoothly. So, I took a step back and am trying  
a new approach. I took out of the attic my old laptop. At the time it was a  
bad beast. Macbook Pro based on Intel this time. I am trying. What will be  
will be. What is important is to try, at most I will succeed.  
In parallel, I'm also diving into [kind][3]. For those who don't know, it's an  
abbreviation of Kubernetes in Docker. One of the lighter versions adapted to a  
local development environment and CI. That's what they say. I haven't tried yet.

I have dug enough and therefore I will go to the stage of the identical
questions:-  
Did this post bring you new insights?  
Did you learn something you didn't know before?  
Have you faced a similar challenge in a different way? in different tools?
